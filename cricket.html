<h1><p  style= "text -align=left"> The game usually lasts two overs for each batting innings. This can quickly build pressure for the batting side so you want to take advantage of every delivery to score runs</p></h1>

<h1><p style="text-align=left">It is important to read the field and bowling but in the end timing matters a lot. Whether you will score a six, lose a wicket or waste a ball, all depends on how well you time a hit in this game,”</p></h1>

<h1><p style="text-align=left">A well-timed lofted shot ensures six runs. But if your timing is not perfect, you might waste a chance for runs or lose a wicket.
“Sometimes it is wiser to hold on with the big hit for a couple of balls till you get a sense of the pace that the ball is coming on to your bat. This is also sensible to do if the bowling changes, particularly from fast to slow. In fact, one needs be a little more cautious with the slow bowlers and spinners as the pace of the ball becomes difficult to judge and hence there is a higher chance of getting your timing wrong,”</p></h1>
